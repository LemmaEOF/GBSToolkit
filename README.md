# GBS Toolkit
 *Various Python tools for messing around with GB Studio projects.*
 
GBS Toolkit is a few tools I've built while working on Soul and Silicon, a
queer/trans dating simulator I'm writing for the GameBoy Color. It's a very
text-heavy game, and while GB Studio has a dialogue review section, it can't
always easily handle lots of branching dialogue, and there's no way for it to
add new dialogue. **This project is a work in progress.**

## Current Features
- Dump all the dialogue in your project into separate text files for review
- Dumping and loading variable names to/from a text file

## Planned Features
- Import dialogue in a text file into the project JSON
- Alternative visual text editor interface with automatic dialogue previews

## Requirements
- Tested with GB Studio v2.0 beta 5. Other versions may not work properly.
- Python 3.5 or higher.

however you want, as long as you're not being exploitative with it. Thank you
